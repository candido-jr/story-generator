Create a continuous, short, and humorous story involving famous people in a sequence of connected events. The story should be light-hearted, with a fun and unexpected twist by the end. Each part of the story should build on the previous one, leading to a climax and resolution. The characters should be well-known public figures, and the situations should become progressively more absurd but still logically connected. For each part of the story, provide a table where the first column contains a short phrase that describes the event happening at that moment, and the second column contains a detailed MidJourney prompt for creating an image that represents that part of the story. Ensure that the visuals and mood evolve in sync with the narrative and that they have continuity across frames in style (which should always be realistic), aspect ration (which should always be 9:16), character appearance (clothing, expressions), and setting (a sunny beach). Each scene should include exaggerated facial expressions to match the humorous tone.
